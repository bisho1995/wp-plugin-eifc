This plugin extracts the email ids from the comments in your website. It can get email id from any comment which you have not deleted (approved,spam).

== Description ==

This plugin extracts the email ids from the comments in your website. It can get email id from any comment which you have not deleted which means it gets all email ids from your comment categories which are categorized as spam or approved. 

How it works?

WordPress maintains a database where it stores the comments, there the email ids are also stored. This plugin gets the email ids from that database.
